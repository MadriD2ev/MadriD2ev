# üëã Hello Moon !  

#### Developer Web :shipit: Full Stack üë©üèª‚Äçüîß   Curious :eyes: :headphones:  Ciberseguridad üìá   Angry (sometimes) but Chida :poop: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: #womenInTech üë©üèª‚Äçüéì

#### :wrench::hammer: **_Working in progress... Data Scientist_** :woman_factory_worker:

Hello.

I am currently a FullStack developer, I have knowledge of ReactJS, Boopstrap, CSS, HTML, JS, Serverless, MySQL, SQL and NodeJS in a microservices work environment through lambdas and Api Gateway in AWS.

Previously built web functionality using the .NET Framework and C#, Javascript (JS), AJAX, CSS, HTML5, jQwidgets, jQuery, and SQL Server.

I like to participate in different activities other than development because it allows me to learn from my colleagues, from the situation (infrastructure, tools) and I can contribute through my work, ideas, experience and solutions. I am dynamic, enthusiastic and I adapt to changes easily.

Due to this I have been able to carry out data migration, information analysis, reverse engineering, technical drawing on board marine platforms, technical support in some companies in the Oil & Gas sector, providing offshore service to users.

Personally, I have done some activities out of curiosity, to continue learning, such as:

 *My personal site with Angular, Typescript and Firebase.

 *I have entered some civic hacking and open, social data challenges (Social Data Challenge) in which they tried to solve a social problem in my case of an environmental nature through data science in which I used Python, Pandas, Numpy, Google Collab.

 *I have been given the opportunity to participate in the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations through #INACAP (training platform of the Technological University of Chile) and in the School of Data Science dependent on the Mathematics Applications Laboratory, Cuernavaca Unit of the Institute of UNAM Mathematics.

 *Basic cybersecurity and ethical hacking courses.

Interests:
 Data science and web development.
